# Neural Network Application in Engine Diagnostics
In this study, the Neural Network Machine Learning is used for failure identification in an aircraft engine. In order to execute the identification, the neural network must first detect if the overall engine output classified as failing. Then, it isolates the failing part of the engine. Then, it quantifies the output values of the said part. 

## Parts name:
* The combined_part is the executable MATLAB subroutine, use this if you want to execute the entire neural network or changing the input dataset name
* myNeuralNetworkFunctionxxx files are the neural network parameters. Change this if you want to fine tune the result of the parameters.
* The excel files are the input datasets. Change this for a new engine data
